# UMass Shimmer Project

Welcome to the UMass Shimmer Project documentation. This project focuses on developing and implementing sensor technology using Shimmer wireless sensor platforms for research and development at the University of Massachusetts.

## What is Shimmer?

Shimmer is a wireless sensor platform designed for real-time human motion analysis, environmental monitoring, and physiological measurements. The UMass Shimmer project builds upon this technology to create innovative solutions for:

- **Health and wellness monitoring**
- **Research applications** 
- **Environmental sensing**
- **Movement and activity tracking**

## Quick Start
