# Experimental Results

This page documents experimental validation and results for the UMass Shimmer project components.

## RTC Timing Validation
Validation of real-time clock (RTC) synchronization between Shimmer devices and the Android docking app.

### Results
- Timing accuracy: Â±10 sec between docking and file collection, 1 or 2 min delay from switching on the Shimmer
- RMS error from Python Script to the original decoding MATLAB Script:
