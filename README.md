## üß≠ Overview

The **UMass Shimmer Project** is a modular platform built by the University of Massachusetts research community to automate **data extraction, decoding, and synchronization** of Shimmer sensor data.
It integrates three coordinated subsystems ‚Äî **Android Docking**, **Serverless Cloud Backend**, and a **Web Visualization Interface** ‚Äî designed for scalability, automation, and fault tolerance.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The architecture connects a local-first Android docking app with a fully serverless AWS backend. A separate web portal enables researchers to visualize, filter, and download decoded sensor data.


### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Android Docking Subsystem**

üì¶ **Repository:** [shimmerumass/shimmer-docking-android](https://github.com/shimmerumass/shimmer-docking-android)

The **ShimmerDock Android app** automates nightly extraction and synchronization of data from Shimmer sensors using Bluetooth RFCOMM.

#### Workflow

1. **Device Discovery** ‚Äì Scans and verifies docking state via Bluetooth.
2. **File Transfer** ‚Äì Transfers data using a reliable chunk-based ACK/NACK protocol.
3. **Local Caching** ‚Äì Stores files in private app storage and logs sync status via SQLite.
4. **Cloud Sync** ‚Äì Uploads to S3 via pre-signed URLs (>5 MB files handled efficiently).

#### Design Highlights

* Built in **Java** for precise control over RFCOMM and background tasks.
* Operates as a **state machine**, with scanning, transfer, and sync as independent states.
* Nightly automation powered by **Android AlarmManager**.
* **Firebase Crashlytics** integrated for operational logging and error monitoring.
* **Local-first architecture** ensures no data loss in offline environments.


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud Processing and API Layer**

üì¶ **Repository:** [shimmerumass/shimmer-cloud-api](https://github.com/shimmerumass/shimmer-cloud-api)

The backend is implemented using **Python (FastAPI)** and deployed serverlessly via **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**.
It ingests, decodes, and manages uploaded Shimmer binary files from the Android subsystem.

#### Architecture Overview

* Files uploaded from the mobile app are stored in **Amazon S3**.
* A **pre-signed URL** strategy allows uploads > 6 MB directly to S3, avoiding HTTP timeouts.
* The **FastAPI + Mangum** stack exposes REST endpoints for file registration and retrieval.
* **Serverless execution** ensures zero idle cost and automatic horizontal scaling.

#### AWS Components

| Service              | Role                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S3**               | Stores raw binary and decoded JSON data (under `/decode/`).            |
| **DynamoDB**         | Maintains metadata: file names, timestamps, device IDs, user mappings. |
| **Lambda (FastAPI)** | Handles file registration, decode triggers, and retrieval requests.    |
| **CloudWatch**       | Centralized logging and performance monitoring.                        |
| **IAM**              | Enforces least-privilege access across AWS resources.                  |

#### Performance Optimizations

* **Serverless architecture** reduces operational complexity and cost.
* **Hybrid storage (S3 + DynamoDB)** separates large raw data from metadata, improving query latency by **‚âà 80 %** (from 10‚Äì12 s ‚Üí 2‚Äì3 s).
* **Lambda memory increased from 512 MB ‚Üí 1769 MB**, improving decoding speed by **‚âà 75 %**
  *(52 s ‚Üí 13 s for a 1.4 MB file).*
* Fully modular cloud design enables the **mobile and cloud layers to evolve independently** while preserving a single data model.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization and Web Interface**

üì¶ **Repository:** [shimmerumass/shimmer-web-ui](https://github.com/shimmerumass/shimmer-web-ui)

A lightweight Angular-based interface provides tools for data visualization and management.

#### Features

* Query metadata and filter files by user, device, or session.
* Fetch and download decoded JSON files directly from S3.
* Supports **downsampling** for large datasets (6 k+ points) for improved chart readability.
* Built with **Angular** for modular, component-based development.
* Authentication and authorization powered by **AWS Amplify User Pools**.

#### Planned Extensions

* Analytical dashboards for multi-sensor studies.
* Integration with external research tools and ML pipelines.
